== JS Clock

Inspired by http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1j9ush/digital_clock_comprised_of_analog_clocks/ which came from http://humanssince1982.com/

Notes: There are bugs, it is not finished this was a short afternoon work and I've never done JS canvas animations before!

TODO:
* I want the clocks to animate more as in the art exhibit.
